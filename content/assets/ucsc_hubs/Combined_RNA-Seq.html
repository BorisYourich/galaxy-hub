    <h1>Combined_RNA-Seq</h1>
    The data from the Combined_RNA-Seq track is obtained from the JBrowse instance at plasmodb.org,
    https://plasmodb.org/plasmo/jbrowse/index.html?data=%2Fa%2Fservice%2Fjbrowse%2Ftracks%2Fdefault&tracks=Pfalciparum3D7%20combined%20RNAseq%20plot
    which is curated by VEuPathDB (<a href="https://veupathdb.org">https://veupathdb.org</a>, release 38).
    The BigWig data files were obtained from the VEuPathDB API and the chromosome names were changed to match
    what is used at UCSC. Since the files were manipulated, there is a chance that some
    error was introduced, and you should always check results with what is provided directely
    by VEuPathDB.

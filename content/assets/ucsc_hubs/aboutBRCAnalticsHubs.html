    <h1>Genome Browser hubs for BRC Analytics hosted by Galaxy</h1>
    <p>The Genome Browser hubs hosted on
    <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/">GalaxyProject.org</a> for BRC Analytics are
    mostly or all derived from data hosted at VEuPathDB.org (release 38) from their
    JBrowse instance. Data files of type BigBed are derived from accessing their
    API to get feature data, which is then converted to GFF3, then to Bed, and finally
    to BigBed, so understand that there are certainly several places along the way for
    errors to be introduced. You should always check data you find on this hub against
    what is available at VEuPathDB.</p>

    <p>Data of type BigWig are also obtained from VEuPathDB, but the files should be
    exactly the same as what is hosted there.</p>

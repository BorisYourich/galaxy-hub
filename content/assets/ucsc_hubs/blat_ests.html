    <h1>EST Alignments</h1>
    The data from the EST Alignments track is obtained from the JBrowse instance at plasmodb.org,
    https://plasmodb.org/plasmo/jbrowse/index.html?data=%2Fa%2Fservice%2Fjbrowse%2Ftracks%2Fdefault&tracks=est
    which is curated by VEuPathDB (<a href="https://veupathdb.org">https://veupathdb.org</a>, release 38).
    Data files of type BigBed are derived from accessing their
    API to get feature data, which is then converted to GFF3, then to Bed, and finally
    to BigBed, so understand that there are certainly several places along the way for
    errors to be introduced. You should always check data you find on this hub against
    what is available at VEuPathDB.</p>

testimonials:
    - quote: "Went from zero bioinformatics experience to publishing my first paper in 18 months. Galaxy made it possible."
      attribution: "Marine Biology Researcher"

    - quote: "My undergrads can now run the same analyses that took my PhD students weeks to set up. That's Galaxy for you."
      attribution: "Bioinformatics Professor"

    - quote: "Same Galaxy workflow, three years running across four different projects. Now that's reproducible science."
      attribution: "Genomics Lab"

    - quote: "No more 'it works on my machine' headaches. Galaxy workflows just work, period."
      attribution: "Computational Biology Student"

    - quote: "Our wet lab researchers are now doing their own RNA-seq analysis. Galaxy removed the computational bottleneck."
      attribution: "Research Institute Director"

    - quote: "Galaxy's visualizations helped us catch a pattern we'd been missing for months. Sometimes you need a fresh perspective."

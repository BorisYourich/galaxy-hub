testimonials:
    - quote: "I went from zero bioinformatics experience to publishing papers in 18 months. Galaxy made the impossible possible."
      attribution: "Marine Biology Researcher"

    - quote: "My undergrads can now run the same analyses that took my PhD students weeks to set up. That's the power of Galaxy."
      attribution: "Bioinformatics Professor"

    - quote: "We've been using the same Galaxy workflow for three years across four different projects. Talk about reproducible science."
      attribution: "Genomics Lab"

    - quote: "No more 'works on my machine' problems. Galaxy workflows just work, everywhere, every time."
      attribution: "Computational Biology Student"

    - quote: "Our wet lab researchers are now doing their own RNA-seq analysis. Galaxy removed the computational bottleneck."
      attribution: "Research Institute Director"

    - quote: "The data visualization in Galaxy helped us spot a pattern we'd missed for months in traditional analysis."
      attribution: "Cancer Research Team"

    - quote: "When our local cluster went down, we moved everything to Galaxy public servers in an afternoon. Lifesaver."
      attribution: "Small University Lab"

    - quote: "I teach Galaxy to 200+ students each semester. The learning curve is practically flat compared to command line tools."
      attribution: "Bioinformatics Instructor"

    - quote: "Galaxy turned our messy collection of scripts into clean, documented workflows that anyone can understand."
      attribution: "Pharmaceutical Researcher"

    - quote: "Best research decision we made was switching to Galaxy. The community support alone is worth it."

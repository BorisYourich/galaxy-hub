Since Galaxy now supports Onedata as a Remote data source (Files Source Plugin) and Object Store,
this Webinar may be useful for Galaxy users wishing to import their datasets or 
extend their quota using their Onedata accounts. It will revolve mostly around 
the new features of DataHub and Onedata, but basics will also be presented. 

Time: 14:00 - 15:00 CEST.

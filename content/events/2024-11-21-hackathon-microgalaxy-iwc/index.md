# Objectives

The primary goal of this hackathon is to **prepare**, **integrate**, and **FAIRify** **microbial data analysis Galaxy workflows** within the Intergalactic Workflow Commission (IWC), ensuring they adhere to best practices for accessibility, interoperability, and reusability across the bioinformatics community. IWC acts as a central hub for Galaxy workflows, automatically listing them in major registries like Dockstore and WorkflowHub, while ensuring workflows are rigorously reviewed, tested, and updated with every new Galaxy release. Versioning, tool updates, and essential metadata enhance the findability and usability of each workflow.

In short, the objectives of this hackathon are to:

* Annotate and apply best practices to microbial data analysis Galaxy workflows for consistency and reusability
* Implement robust tests to ensure workflow reliability and accuracy
* Successfully integrate key microbial data analysis Galaxy workflows into IWC, improving accessibility and usability
* Collaborate as a community to refine and improve workflows, ensuring they are peer-reviewed and meet high standards
* Make these peer-reviewed workflows accessible to the broader community through the future microGalaxy Lab

This hackathon is open to participants from all communities, so join us to help shape the future of bioinformatics workflows! Experts and IWC experienced users will be participating in the hackathon to support and explain the requirements during the event.

We’re excited to share that our colleague [Dr. Sanjay Kumar Srikakulam](https://github.com/sanjaysrikakulam) will be presenting at an upcoming session of [Data Snacks](https://www.dsc-ub.de/en/data_snacks_en.php), a virtual event series offering bite-sized insights into effective research data management. In just 30 minutes, Data Snacks talks are about handling research data responsibly in line with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).

Dr. Srikakulam’s session will focus on Galaxy, an open-source platform that enables scientists from various disciplines to process, manage, and share their data with no programming required. With thousands of built-in tools such as RStudio, Jupyter notebook, and RDM tools as well as integrations with services like [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/), [Google Drive](https://workspace.google.com/products/drive/), and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), Galaxy supports the entire research data lifecycle, from data import to long-term archiving. Whether you're analyzing sequencing data or exploring machine learning applications, Galaxy makes data-driven research more accessible, transparent, and reproducible.

Join us on Thursday, 08.05.2025, from 1:00 to 1:30 PM via [Zoom for a live presentation](https://uni-bremen.zoom-x.de/j/61666538039?pwd=JZTcc15FcsrZwedVYuMoVuhp3sPLCF.1) followed by a short discussion.

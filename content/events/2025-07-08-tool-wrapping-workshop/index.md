We’re excited to host our first hands-on workshop on Galaxy tool development in Freiburg. This 1st session is tailored for internal team members, but we plan to offer regular workshops in the future—both online and in-person—targeted at a broad range of scientific communities and disciplines.

Whether you're new to the Galaxy ecosystem or looking to contribute to the [Intergalactic Utilities Commission (IUC)](https://galaxyproject.org/iuc/), these workshops will offer a valuable opportunity to learn from experienced instructors and developers and gain hands-on experience in building or updating Galaxy tools.

# What You'll Learn
## Day 1: Step-by-Step Walkthrough of Galaxy Tool Development
- Setting up your development environment ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), [Planemo](https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/), [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/linux.html))
- Writing, testing, and publishing Galaxy tools
- Understanding and contributing to the Galaxy tool ecosystem

## Day 2: Bring Your Own Tool or Contribute to the [IUC Repository](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc)
- Wrap your own tool using Galaxy best practices
- Or, enhance an existing [IUC](https://galaxyproject.org/iuc/) tool by improving tests, versions, or functionality

# Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of shell scripting and command-line tools
- Familiarity with Python and/or R is helpful but not required
- Please ensure that [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (with the [Galaxy extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=davelopez.galaxy-tools)), [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/), and [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/linux.html) are installed prior to the event

Number of Participants: 12

# Recommended Resources

We’re excited to share that [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) is hosting [an online talk on the Galaxy platform](https://myimperial.powerappsportals.com/events/event/?id=fc1d2204-b36e-41a5-9546-455748647388&readableEventId=Galaxy_the_research_data_powerhousefrom_analysis_to_FAIR_management3267684407). This is a good opportunity for researchers, data scientists, and IT specialists to explore how Galaxy supports end-to-end data analysis across various disciplines.

**Date**: July 10, 2025

**Time**: 13:00–14:00 BST (14:00–15:00 CEST)

Register for the event using this [link](https://myimperial.powerappsportals.com/events/event/?id=fc1d2204-b36e-41a5-9546-455748647388&readableEventId=Galaxy_the_research_data_powerhousefrom_analysis_to_FAIR_management3267684407).

**What to Expect:**

The session will provide an overview of the Galaxy platform’s capabilities for data analysis, sharing, and management — with a focus on making cutting-edge tools accessible to all researchers. You’ll also learn how Galaxy supports compliance with FAIR principles and helps streamline research workflows on local and international infrastructure.

**Speaker:**

José Manuel Domínguez (University of Freiburg) is a developer and administrator of Galaxy Europe. With a background in physics and mathematics, José works on building infrastructure that empowers researchers through scalable, open, and user-friendly technologies.

Whether you're new to Galaxy or already using it in your projects, this session is a good chance to see how others are leveraging its features and to get your questions answered. Join us and bring your team!

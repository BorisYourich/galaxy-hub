# Join Us for Optimising Metagenomics Assembled Genomes Building Workflows

Metagenomics Assembled Genomes building workflows are both **technically and scientifically challenging**, yet they are **essential tools** for reducing microbial dark matter, as most microbes cannot be cultivated.  

As part of the [FAIRyMAGs project](https://artifact.galaxyproject.org/news/2025-01-09-bfsp-fairy-ma-gs/) within the [ELIXIR BFSP Programme](https://elixir-europe.org/internal-projects/commissioned-services/science/biodiversity-security-pathogens), we are organizing a **4-day hackathon (October 6-9th)** and 1-day for an optional social event (October 10th). We warmly invite the community to join us either **in person in Freiburg** or **online**. This event is an opportunity to **collaborate, discuss, and improve MAGs workflows together!**  

FAIRyMAGs is led by Paul Zierep (ELIXIR-DE) and B√©r√©nice Batut (ELIXIR-FR) in collaboration with Giuseppe Defazio (ELIXIR-IT), Bruno Fosso (ELIXIR-IT), Martin Beracochea (EMBL-EBI), Santiago Sanchez (EMBL-EBI), that will be participating the hackathon.

# Registration

Registration is free, but the space is limited to 15 attendees, so we recommend to register soon. Please wait for our confirmation before booking your trip. As this is a hybrid event, remote attendance is also possible.

# Event Details

- **Dates**: October 06th‚Äì10th, 2025 - This event is right after the [European Galaxy Days (EGD)](/events/2025-10-01-egd2025/), so you have the chance to make it a longer trip to Freiburg and profit from both events. 
- **Location**: Georges-Koehler-Allee 079, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany & Online
- **Cost**: Free
- **Contact**: Paul Zierep, B√©r√©nice Batut
- **Focus**: Enhancing FAIR MAGs building Workflows, Developing user-friendly training materials, Advancing workflow evaluation methods, Building intelligent computational resource estimation tools


# Objectives

The objectives of this 4-day scientific and technical hackathon are to optimize Metagenomics Assembled Genomes building by:

- üöÄ **Enhancing FAIR MAGs building Workflows**
  - Optimizing assembly strategies: Individual assembly vs. co-assembly vs. grouped-assembly, Automating decision-making for assembly selection
  - Bin refinement improvements: Where do we go beyond MetaWrap? Should we integrate more binning tools for better results?

- üìö **Developing user-friendly training materials**

- üìä **Advancing workflow evaluation methods** (using CAMI infrastructure & real data)
  - Have metagenomic WGS samples? Want to create MAGs? This is your chance!

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Building intelligent computational resource estimation tools**

    Whether you're using Nextflow, Snakemake, or Galaxy, resource allocation is key. Over-provisioning wastes resources; under-provisioning leads to failed jobs. Let‚Äôs **design** **workflow-agnostic tools** that **optimize resource usage**, **reducing computational waste and environmental impact**!

### Getting to Freiburg

Freiburg can be easily reached by train with the ICE from the North (via Frankfurt and Karlsruhe) and the South (via
Basel) [Deutsche Bahn](https://www.bahn.com/en).

#### How to reach Freiburg from Basel/Mulhouse/Freiburg airport (EuroAirport)?

- Option 1: Use the French/German exit and take
  the [airport shuttle bus](https://www.freiburger-reisedienst.de/index.php) to Freiburg main station (Hauptbahnhof).
- Option 2: Use the Swiss exit and take the local bus (#50) to the train station in Basel and from there take a train
  to Freiburg.

#### How to reach the venue from Freiburg Hauptbahnhof?

- Option 1: Local train; Take the Breisgau S-Bahn from Hauptbahnhof Freiburg to Gottenheim/Breisach towards "Freiburg Messe/Universit√§t".
- Option 2: Tram 4 direction "Messe"; Exit at the stop "Technische Fakult√§t" (see [tram plan](https://www.vag-freiburg.de/fahrplan/liniennetzplaene)).

The [mobile app](https://www2.bwegt.de/reiseinformationen/apps) of the local public transport company [bwegt](https://www2.bwegt.de/) can also be very helpful to check the schedule of the trains and buses.

### Tram tickets for local transport

[Here](https://www.vag-freiburg.de/tickets) you can find the types of tram tickets that VAG offers.
The [2x4 rides ticket](https://www.vag-freiburg.de/ticket/2x4-fahrten-karte) and the [day pass](https://www.vag-freiburg.de/ticket/tageskarte-solo) are convenient options for several days and/or passengers.

# Remote attendance

Hacking is not restricted to onsite, we appreciate your participation from anywhere else, too. We will have a Zoom room, open the whole 4 days, and involve a Meeting Owl to include you as close as possible.

# Preliminary Schedule

The schedule is flexible, with no fixed end times each day; decisions will be made onsite with participants.
Will will focus on specific topics each day, but one can also work on specific ideas individually. 
There is no requirement to attend the entire week. For example, if your primary interest is Training Development, feel free to join us on Thursday.

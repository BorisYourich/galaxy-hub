# Workshop - Introduction to Galaxy for Digital Humanities and Research Data Management

**Please note, this workshop will be held in German**

Researchers entering the Digital Humanities are often confronted with high software costs, a lack of programming skills, and limited computing resources. 
So, how can efficient and good scientific practice be achieved including good research data management?

Our workshop introduces the open source platform Galaxy, which addresses these challenges. 
Using the example of a text comparison of Chinese newspapers, participants will learn how the Galaxy analysis platform, originally developed for the life sciences, 
supports research in the Digital Humanities without any programming knowledge. Instead of a time-consuming manual comparison of texts, the workshop will demonstrate how 
differences in the texts can be automatically extracted in the platform. 
If desired, the (partial) results of the analysis and the workflow can be shared with just a few clicks or repeated with different parameters, facilitating FAIR research data management. 
The Galaxy Training Network, with over 400 tutorials, also offers open educational resources that can be used for both independent learning and teaching.

The workshop offers an introduction to Galaxy, after which researchers can use the platform for their own analyses. 
In addition to text analyses, numerous programs for analyzing images and audio files are also available. Thanks to its modular design, Galaxy offers broad application potential 
across various disciplines. Researchers can focus on their core competencies while simultaneously improving the visibility and traceability 
of their methods, thus addressing the typical challenges of digital analysis in the humanities. And all this from within the browser.

The workshop takes place from 14-16ct, please register [via this Email](mailto:digitalhumanities@mail.uni-freiburg.de)

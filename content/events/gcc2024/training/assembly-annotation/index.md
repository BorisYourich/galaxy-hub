# Assembly and Annotation

</div>

In this training session, participants will be instructed on the comprehensive methodologies for genome assembly and annotation using the Galaxy platform. The session will  cover the s process of assembling raw sequencing reads into contiguous sequences, followed by the annotation of the assembled genome to  identify genes and functional elements. Attendees will engage in hands-on practice with Galaxy's interface and assembly tools.

# Intro to Galaxy Development

</div>

This training is an introduction to the basics of development in Galaxy; such as the lifecycle of setting up a local Galaxy instance, making minor changes to the client or backend, and eventually seeing those changes reflected on the local application. Trainees will be given a brief overview of the client and backend infrastructure, to get a better picture of how dev changes end up on the Galaxy platform.

## Meet the Instructor

### Ahmed Hamid Awan
Johns Hopkins University <br>
Galaxy Developer

### Dannon Baker

## Prerequisites

Attendees are encouraged to have the following requirements fulfilled for the training:

- Bring a laptop capable of running Galaxy
- Have a functional, familiar code editor (VS Code is a great option)
- Have git installed locally   (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- Have Python 3.8 installed (Galaxy requires version 3.8, to check your version run `python -V`)

### Good to Have:

It would be even more helpful if attendees are able to come with galaxy cloned locally, via:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy.git
```

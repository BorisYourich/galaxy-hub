The fifth Work Package (WP5) of the EuroScienceGateway project will demonstrate the benefits of the EuroScienceGateway services with 3 communities, namely:

- [Biodiversity](/news/2022-12-08-esg-wp5-biodiversity/) and [Climate Science](/news/2022-11-24-esg-wp1/) with the impact on human health
- [Materials science](/news/2023-01-09-esg-wp5/)
- [Astronomy](/news/2022-12-12-esg-wp5-astronomy/)

WP5 will showcase results from these 3 early adopters that will lead by example to embrace Open Science best practices.

Each of the adopters are at a different level of maturity in their adoption of
Galaxy. Together with [WP1](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/news/?tag=esg-wp1), WP5 will support the early adopters as well as
new communities to get the most out of the EuroScienceGateway and extend it if needed.
Discussions between hardware, software, and application developers will take place to ensure the
community-driven nature of EuroScienceGateway. WP5 will endeavour to support other technical work
packages to provide feedback from the field researchers (about their usage and workflow compositions) in an
effective and relevant way.

KPIs will be derived and monitored for:
- the number and usage of tools and workflows developed by the communities
- the number of data sources accessible via Galaxy
- the number and usage of distributed compute nodes (Pulsar Network).

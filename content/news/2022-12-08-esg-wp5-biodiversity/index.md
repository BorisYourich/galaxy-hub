Within the [WP5](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/news/?tag=esg-wp5) of the EuroScienceGateway project, the Biodiversity community will be one of the demonstrators for the benefits of the EuroScienceGateway services.

This community is already familiar with the Galaxy ecosystem, and we will leverage this project to:

- identify new tools and resources to be integrated
- improve the discovery, usability and reuse of large, diverse, distributed and authoritative biodiversity datasets from Galaxy
- facilitate the compute-intensive annotation of large number of genomes
- develop customizable workflows to facilitate the analysis of qualitative and quantitative correlations between biodiversity features or derived indices, and climate changes

As an example, we will particularly work on data from large scale genome sequencing projects, including the [European Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA)](https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/).

In this frame, we will work on the discoverability of data coming from the [GenomeArk](https://genomeark.github.io/). We will also implement new state-of-the-art tools and workflows (see examples below), able to process automatically high volumes of genome assemblies or annotations.

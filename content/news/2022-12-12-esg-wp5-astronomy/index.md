Astronomy community will be one of the domain use cases of EuroScienceGateway project [WP5](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/news/?tag=esg-wp5).

There is a large potential for improvement for harmonization of rich and diverse open science practices in Astronomy with similar activities in other domains, such as BioInformatics, material science, and others.
 
[EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) and [UPC](https://apc.u-paris.fr/APC_CS/) partners will engage in EuroScienceGateway project to integrate catalogs of astronomical workflows and data, such as those included in the [MMODA](https://www.astro.unige.ch/mmoda/) platform with Galaxy ecosystem.

This is especially interesting and important for emerging field of multi-messenger astronomy combining results from different telescopes and detectors (radio, visible light, X-ray, gamma-ray, gravitational wave, neutrino, cosmic ray) to derive holistic view on the nature of astronomical sources.
This approach requires efficient interoperability between diverse data and data analysis workflows.

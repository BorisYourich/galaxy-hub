The Materials Science community has just relatively recently adopted the Galaxy platform. 
This community is vast and the example chosen, within WP5 of the EuroScienceGateway (ESG)
project, to show the benefits of the ESG services belongs to the field of muon spectroscopy (Î¼SR).
      
Within this field, the Muon Spectroscopy Computational Project [MSCP](https://muon-spectroscopy-computational-project.github.io/index.html),
based at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the United Kingdom, is working on building
software tools for modelling muon spectroscopy experiments. The MSCP has chosen Galaxy
as the main platform to make these tools easily available to experimental muon scientists,
and enable sharing of FAIR workflows for muon simulations. So far, many of the software 
tools developed by the MSCP have been incorporated into Galaxy following best practices; and 
we are now deploying a [MuonGalaxy](https://muongalaxy.stfc.ac.uk/)
portal to leverage on the EuroScienceGateway services and foster
Open Science practices in the muon science community. Our aims include improving interactions 
within the the muon science field well as connecting to the wider materials science community, 
including users of national facilities, such as muon and neutron sources, where 
there already are other early adopters of the Galaxy platform.  Among them, scientists from 
the US at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which
have developed the Galaxy instances to treat X-Ray data and neutron data.

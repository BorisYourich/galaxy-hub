# EuroScienceGateway WP2

The [**EuroScienceGateway**](/projects/esg/) partner The University of Manchester is leading the work package WP2 _Stimulate FAIR and reusable research_, contributing with expertise on [FAIR Computational Workflows](https://workflows.community/groups/fair/)). Other WP2 partners include EPFL, VIB, BSC, EGI, UP, UiO.

This work package adds sufficient measures to EuroScienceGateway to support FAIR practices for and by workflows.

WP2 will realize [FAIR Digital Objects](https://fairdo.org/) (FDOs), for exchanging, publishing, archiving and citing workflows and their companion data, provenance logs and associated resources, expanding the community standard [RO-Crate](https://w3id.org/ro/crate) and its use by Galaxy.
 
The FDOs will be published through EOSC and in EOSC catalogues (e.g. [OpenAIRE](https://www.openaire.eu/)) and further communicated through outreach plans to increase uptake of the EuroScienceGateway in affiliated and newly targeted computational researcher communities. 

[WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/), a FAIR registry for workflows that is RO-Crate compliant, will be lifted to TRL-9 status (from TRL-7) and made the registry of choice for all workflow system types and for all disciplines in EOSC. 

FAIR workflows will be promoted as scholarly objects in scientific publishing, working with existing publishers and rapid communication services (e.g. [Astronomerâ€™s Telegrams](http://blogs.astronomerstelegram.org/)). WP2 will also establish workflows to be included in scholarly knowledge graphs.

By collaborating with the [FAIR-IMPACT](https://fair-impact.eu/) project, both the WorkflowHub and Workflow Digital Objects, will be further aligned with its PID, metadata schema frameworks and workflow citation practices.

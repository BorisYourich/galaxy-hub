The Freiburg Galaxy team attended the EUDAT Conference in Karlsruhe, Germany, from December 3rd to 5th, 2024. The conference focused on the most recent breakthroughs in research data management, as well as enabling technologies and solutions.

Dr. Björn Grüning, representing the Galaxy community, gave a talk titled [Navigating the Stars: Unpacking the Galaxy Pulsar Network and Its Role in EU Science](https://b2drop.eudat.eu/s/YmibmTz4d2xNosz?dir=undefined&path=%2FDay%202%20-%204%20Dec%2F1630B%20Cross-border%20or%20cross-domain%20data%20management%20%26%20International%20RDM&openfile=79941143) at the [Cross-border or cross-domain data management and international RDM session](https://www.eudat.eu/events/conferences/eudat-conference-2024/cross-border-cross-domain-data-management). In this session, he presented the Galaxy as a framework that provides tools, infrastructure, and RDM to users from diverse backgrounds ranging from biology to material science.

In a live demo, he demonstrated the Galaxy's Bring Your Own Data (BYOD) capability for data integration (e.g. B2Drop) and accessing files from public repositories such as Zenodo and Invenio with a DOI. Later, he demonstrated Galaxy's Bring Your Own Storage (BYOS) feature, and used a MinIO server to analyze DNA. Then he introduced [Pulsar](https://pulsar-network.readthedocs.io), which enables distributed computing around the globe, including servers in Italy, Belgium, France, and the United Kingdom. Finally, he presented the Bring Your Own Compute ([BYOC](https://galaxyproject.org/news/2023-10-31-esg-byoc-im/)) functionality, which allows users to provide their own computational resources by connecting Pulsar endpoints to Galaxy using [EGI IM](https://im.egi.eu/im-dashboard/login).

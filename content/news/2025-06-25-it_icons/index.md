Galaxy 25.0 introduces a new panel dedicated to Interactive Tools (IT)! This update improves usability by separating ITs from regular tools and helps users to access them easier.

But wait, there's more! Each IT now has its own eye-catching icon!!! (because who doesn't love a good visual upgrade?) These distinctive icons help you spot your favorite interactive tools at a glance.

Ready to explore? Try it out in your Galaxy instance and let us know what you think. We're excited to hear your feedback!

Following our recent announcement of [a generic tool for connecting to astronomical data archives](https://galaxyproject.org/news/2023-09-07-esg-wp5-astronomy-archives/), a dedicated Table Access Protocol (TAP) for multimessenger is now available. In particular, this currently exposes the European Space Agency's (ESA) [INTEGRAL](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Integral) mission data.

By using the [Astronomical Archives tool](https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=astronomical_archives) in Galaxy, you can now connect to this service by using the features made available with this tool. 

This new TAP server can be reached to the URL "http://www.astro.unige.ch/mmoda/dispatch-data/tap/".

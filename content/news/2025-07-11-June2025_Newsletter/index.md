## GBCC Live\! Session

In the spirit of innovation, we introduced “GBCC Live\!” — a thrilling, real-time showcase at this year’s conference. This session walked attendees through the entire journey a researcher takes, from raw data to a manuscript draft, all within an hour and entirely live on stage.

We kicked off with a cutting-edge multiplex tissue image (MTI) analysis pipeline for tissue microarray (TMA) data, recognized by Nature as the 2024 Method of the Year. After exploring cancer datasets, we launched into live analysis, seamlessly importing a peer-reviewed Galaxy workflow and executing it with just a few clicks. Thanks to Galaxy’s new job caching feature, what typically takes 2.5 hours ran in mere seconds.

Next, we dove into interactive results exploration using RStudio and a Shiny app. We demonstrated Galaxy’s upcoming user-defined tools feature, which will soon let users write and reuse custom tools directly within Galaxy workflows.

Taking things further, we showcased running the same workflow entirely from the command line on an HPC system, highlighting Galaxy’s flexibility beyond the GUI for scalable, automated analysis.

Finally, we closed with a groundbreaking demonstration: drafting a manuscript live using Galaxy’s new Model-View-Controller protocol (MCP) paired with an AI chat assistant. By instructing Claude to review our Galaxy history, it generated a draft methods section with tool references in seconds, a glimpse into the future of AI-assisted publishing.

GBCC Live\! powerfully illustrated how Galaxy and Bioconductor seamlessly integrate to support rapid, reproducible research — all in a high-energy, real-world scenario.

## Talk Sessions

Across five curated sessions, GBCC2025 featured over 50 oral presentations showcasing cutting-edge research, novel tools, and impactful community projects. The talks covered a range of topics, including workflow automation and visualization, large-scale data integration, machine learning, and cloud-based analysis.

* **Session 1** opened the conference with a focus on infrastructure innovation and tool integration. Speakers introduced GAIA, a natural language-driven agent for Galaxy analysis, and GalaxyMCP, a novel protocol enabling AI assistants to interact directly with Galaxy servers. Talks continued with new approaches for automatically integrating Bioconductor packages into Galaxy, a user-friendly YAML tool authoring system, and a modern visualization framework designed for seamless deployment. Presenters also showcased use cases in materials science and a new language-agnostic approach for representing genomic data.  
    
* **Session 2** ran as two parallel tracks, offering a rich mix of technical deep dives and domain-specific applications. 

  * **Track 2A** focused on enhancing the Galaxy platform’s power and flexibility. Talks addressed unified interfaces for launching workflows, more intuitive dataset collection tools, and the integration of deep learning for biomedical data science. Presenters also explored quantum machine learning, the use of Galaxy in neutron scattering data visualization, and automation pipelines for tool integration. Novel strategies for workload distribution and a case study on cardiomyocyte gene expression in atrial fibrillation rounded out the session.

  * In **Track 2B**, the spotlight shifted toward Bioconductor applications and genomic medicine. Presentations covered ancestry inference using RAIDS, metaimmunopeptidomics pipelines for immunotherapy, and allele-specific methylation analysis via Oxford Nanopore sequencing. Other talks delved into gene expression signature comparisons across transcriptomic modalities, transcription factor binding predictions, orthology detection, and spatial transcriptomics analysis of lung adenocarcinoma. The track closed with insights into rare variant analysis in biobank-scale datasets and innovative tools for visualizing transcript usage and metagenomic profiling.

## Poster Sessions

The GBCC2025 poster session featured over 50 presentations spanning a broad range of topics in bioinformatics, tool development, and community infrastructure. The session provided an opportunity for in-depth discussion and exchange around both published tools and works in progress.

Several posters expanded on topics introduced in the oral sessions, offering technical details and use-case demonstrations. Notable contributions included GAIA and GalaxyMCP, which explored natural language processing and AI integration in Galaxy, as well as HiFi-MAG, a pipeline for high-fidelity metagenomics. Meta-iPep highlighted immunopeptidomics workflows implemented in Galaxy, and several posters addressed reproducible visualization, including Galaxy’s new JavaScript-based framework. Bioconductor-focused posters included a standardized framework for integrating histopathological imaging with omics data, the “HowTo” educational series, and tools for analyzing spatial and single-cell datasets. Infrastructure efforts were also well represented, with posters on secure Galaxy instances, metadata harmonization, and Earth system science workflows.

The poster session served as a technical complement to the oral program, providing space for detailed conversation, community feedback, and collaboration across the Galaxy and Bioconductor ecosystems.

## Birds of a Feather

The Birds of a Feather sessions at GBCC2025 provided informal, participant-driven spaces for focused discussion, knowledge sharing, and community building. Held across multiple days, these sessions brought together attendees with shared interests to connect on technical challenges, user needs, project updates, and future collaborations.

Topics ranged from Galaxy training infrastructure and FAIR workflows to software development practices, visualization tools, and community coordination across regions and platforms. The flexible, discussion-based format enabled real-time problem-solving, brainstorming, and collaboration among developers, researchers, and educators.

## CoFest

The final two days of GBCC2025 were dedicated to CoFest, a collaborative sprint where community members came together to contribute to open-source projects across Galaxy and Bioconductor. This event encouraged hands-on work in tool development, documentation, updating training materials, and technical integration between platforms.

Participants also worked on outreach and onboarding resources to support new users and contributors, aligning with GBCC’s commitment to accessibility and community growth. A highlight was the joint effort to integrate Bioconductor tools into Galaxy, as captured in the blog post *"Bringing Bioconductor to Galaxy: A CoFest Collaboration*," which shares training materials, tool wrapping progress, and next steps for integration.

Whether refining software, building training content, or improving documentation, CoFest exemplified the collaborative energy that defines both the Galaxy and Bioconductor communities. It was a productive and inclusive close to the week’s events, translating shared goals into real progress.

## Celebrating 20 years of Galaxy

2025 marked a major milestone for the Galaxy community: 20 years of accessible, reproducible, and collaborative science. Since its launch in 2005, Galaxy has evolved into a global platform that supports thousands of tools, powers research across disciplines, and brings together a diverse and active community of users, developers, and educators.

At GBCC2025, this anniversary was more than just a moment of reflection; it was a celebration. The milestone was acknowledged in opening remarks and throughout the week’s sessions, many of which highlighted how Galaxy has helped transform open science over the past two decades. The celebration culminated in a DJ party on Wednesday evening, where attendees gathered to mark the occasion with music and community connection.

From infrastructure innovation to international collaboration, Galaxy’s first 20 years have laid the groundwork for what’s next. As the platform enters its third decade, the commitment to openness, community leadership, and reproducibility remains stronger than ever.

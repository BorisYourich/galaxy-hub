## Analytics for pathogen, host, and vector data

Comprehensive tools for exploring and interpreting genomic annotations and
functional insights into disease-causing organisms and their carriers

BRC Analytics is your new destination for analysis of biological data related to
pathogens. Building on the legacy of VEuPathDb the platform will provide access
and analysis capabilities for 785 eukaryotic pathogens, hosts, and vectors. The
functionality will be developed and made available incrementally over the
following months.

comments:
- "SURF Research Cloud (SRC) allows scientists to use Galaxy and Pulsar in a secure environment."
- "SURF is the collaborative organisation for IT in Dutch education and research."
- "SURF is mainly funded by SURF members and NWO (Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek)"
- "Researchers work in isolated collaborative environments, called collaborations. Inside the collaboration, they can spin up Galaxy that is only accessible to the members of their collaboration."
- "Secure authorization and authentication is handled by SURF Research Access Management (SRAM), where researchers log in with their institutional credentials."
- "SRC is a multicloud environment, where researchers have the option whether they want their workspaces to run on public cloud providers (such as AWS or Azure), or on the private cloud provider (e.g. SURF HPC-Cloud)."

quotas:
- "SRC is ISO/IEC 27001 certified. Applying for access for research purposes is given in the form of small and large NWO compute grant. The small grant gives up to 50,000 CPU and 5,000 GPU core hours of cloud computing on HPC-Cloud, 2TB storage and consultancy hours. Large NWO grants give more computing time, storage and support than the small grant application, depending on the project's needs."

european_infrastructures:
- "SURF is also part of the Dutch Elixir node, the EOSC federated cloud initiative, as well as GÃ‰ANT."
